# CS377 Final Project - Deal Maker
**Created by Daniel Austin and Hunter Kilgore**
## Project Description
Deal Maker is an Android Studio Project designed to help users save money when it comes to purchasing games.
It utilizes [CheapShark API](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/) to pull real time data of game prices and store platforms that sell the game.
From there, users will be able to search for games they are interested in and see the best price for the game and the platform it is being sold on.
Users can also favorite games to add them in a seperate page so that they can more easily access they're saved games to check for if it goes on sale for a better price.
## App Instructions
In order to run the app, potential users must first download the packages from the main branch of our github. Extract them to a file location of your choosing and open Android Studio.
From there, connect the Android Device (or load an Android emulator) and build from Android Studio. Users should now be able to open the app.
For navigating and utilizing the app, type in key words to search for games based on their name.
It will automatically sort the database and display the best possible price for the game as well as the platform it is sold on.
Users can additionally add games to their favorites list by clicking on to the favorite button. 
They can also unfavorite a game by navigating to the favorites tab and clicking the button to remove a game.
